	<h2> REVOLTS </h2>

       <div class="pr1">
        <p> Revolt is a term that admits various meaning. This may be an amendment, a riot or a social uproar. In this case,
		a revolt is a social movement that opposes some figure of power or a certain measure of government and that usually has
		a violent character, and may end badly and be fatal. </p>

        <strong> <h4>Guerra dos Canudos - 1896 a 1897</h4> </strong>
           <p>The so-called War of Canudos, canudos revolution or insurrection of Canudos, was the confrontation between a popular movement
		of socio-religious background and the Army of the Republic, which lasted from 1896 to 1897, in the then community of Canudos,
		in the interior of the state of Bahia, Brazil.
		<br> </p>
		<h1> <img src="../imagens/guerra_canudos.jpg" width="500px"> </h1>
		<p> The episode was the result of a number of factors such as the severe economic and social crisis in which it encountered the region at the time,
		historically characterized by the presence of unproductive large estates, a situation aggravated by the occurrence of cyclical droughts, chronic unemployment;
		by believing in a miraculous salvation that would spare the humble inhabitants of the Sertão dos Flagelos of climate and economic and social 
		exclusion. </p>

        <div class="pr2">
        <strong> <h4> Revolta da Vacina - 1904 </h4> </strong>
           <p>The Vaccine Revolt was a popular revolt that took place in the city of Rio de Janeiro between November 10 and 16, 1904. There were several
		violent urban conflicts between popular and government forces (police and military).
		<br>
		The main cause was the mandatory vaccination campaign against smallpox, carried out by the Brazilian government and led by the public
		health physician Dr. Oswaldo Cruz. The vast majority of the population, made up of poor and uninformed people, did not know how a
		vaccine works and its positive effects. Therefore, they did not want to get the vaccine. </p>
		<h1> <img src="../imagens/revolta_vacina.jpg" width="500px"> </h1>
		<p> The climate of popular discontent with other measures taken by the federal government, which mainly affected the poorest people. 
		Among these measures, we can highlight the urban reform of the city of Rio de Janeiro (then capital of Brazil), which displaced thousands
		of people so that tenements and popular housing were torn down for the construction of more modern avenues, gardens and buildings. </p>

		<div class="pr2">
         <strong><h4> Revolta da Chibata - 1910 </h4></strong>
          <p>The Chibata Revolt was an important naval mutiny movement that took place at the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rio de Janeiro. 
		It began on November 22, 1910. <br>
		During this period, Brazilian sailors were punished with physical punishment. Tomb offenses were punished with 25 lashes (lashes). This situation 
		generated an intense revolt among the sailors. 
		<br> </p>
		<h1> <img src="../imagens/chibata.jpg" width="500px"> </h1>
		<p> The trigger of the revolt occurred when the sailor Marcelino Rodrigues was punished with 250 lashes, for having wounded a Navy colleague,
		inside the battleship Minas Gerais. The warship was going to Rio de Janeiro and the punishment, which took place in the presence of the other 
		sailors, sparked the revolt. <br>
		The mutiny worsened and the insurgents even killed the ship's captain and three other officers. In Guanabara Bay, the rebels managed to get 
		the support of sailors from the battleship São Paulo. The atmosphere became tense and dangerous. </p>
        </div> 
		
		<div class="pr2">
        <strong><h4> Tenentismo - 1922</h4> </strong>
          <p> The first tenentist revolt broke out on July 5, 1922 and was led by 18 lieutenants, who gathered a troop of 300 men, decided 
		to act against the government and prevent the inauguration of President Artur Bernades. But the revolt was unsuccessful with
		a troop superior to theirs the government ended up winning the battle and from this fight only two rebels escaped alive: 
		Eduardo Gomes and Siqueira Campos. <br>
		<br> </p>
		<h1> <img src="../imagens/tenentismo.jpg" width="500px"> </h1>
		<p> The lieutenants preached the moralization of public administration, the end of electoral corruption, the end of the open 
		vote and wanted a reform in education, so that education would be for all Brazilians. They achieved the sympathy of the middle
		class and the proletariat, but not of the working class, who for them created the true position among explorers and exploited. </p>
