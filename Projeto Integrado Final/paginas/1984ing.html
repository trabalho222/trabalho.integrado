       <div class="pr1">
        <p> We had to read the dystopian novel writen by George Orwell in the year 1949, 1984. The aim of the book was to create a very distant reality, but close to 
		the possible that humanity would show in the future. <br>
		Incredibly, in 1984, there was still not much that approached the reality of humanity, but today in 2021, we see bizarrely many similarities.</p>

	<h6> Brief Summary </h6>
	
		<div class="pr2">
		
		<p>  The book tells the story of Winston Smith, a middle-aged man and member of the Out Party. He worked as an employee of the Ministry of Truth, where he rewrote
		and altered data according to the interests of the Party. The book's chapters can be divided into three parts: the first part tells how the society created by George 
		was like, a society inspired by the opression of the totalitarian regimes of the 30's and 40's. The world it was divided into three distinct nations: Oceania (where
		Winston lived), Eurasia and Eastasia, territories that were at war with each other. Each nation was governed by the Party, which was coordinated by Big Brother and
		the members of the Inner Party. </p>
		<br>
		<p> The rest of the population was divided between Outer Party members and offspring. The members of the Inner Party were healthy people with benefits, where as
		the Outer Party it had no benefits, but it was not totally abandoned as to its offspring. The Party's motto was:
		</p><br>
<h3>
	"WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY AND IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH".
	</h3>	<br>

   <p> The party was represented by the four Ministries, that of Truth, responsible for everything that is written following the logic that the Party is infallible
   and never missed. The Ministry of Peace, responsible for the war, Ministry of Abundance, responsible for the economy and the Ministry of Love, responsible for spying and
   population control. As a spying tool, telescreens were used that observed all members of the Broken at all times. </p>

	The second part of the book, tell of Winston's internal revolution, as he did not agree with the Party's ideals. Winston meets a young woman named Julia and
	begins to have secret dates with her, as relationship were extremely prohibited by the Party. Purchase in the common market, wearing any type of adornment, being
	alone for a long time or walking in the neighbourhoods where the offspring lived were also prohibited. The third part shows the outcome of the book, where Orwell 
	shows that the totalitarian practice is efficient in maintaining order, because the people who were caught by the Ministry of Truth disappeared and all evidence
	of their existence was erased or they were tortured and re-educated to return to society. </p>
